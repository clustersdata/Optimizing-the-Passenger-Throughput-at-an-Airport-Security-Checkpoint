Problem Notes: Dataset, each column of data is independent of the others as the timing data were collected as several groups of people were coming through the screening process. As in all good modeling, make assumptions about how you interpreted the data set and state your assumptions in your report. The time data for columns A-G are in the format 00:00:0/MM:SS:hundreds of seconds and column H is in the format 0:00/M:SS.
